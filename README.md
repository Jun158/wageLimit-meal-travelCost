*This repo is for my online resume*
This was my first job, a program to format the scraped raw data so that it would be easier to analyze. From the text of the raw data, the program determines the upper and lower limits for hourly, daily, monthly, and annual wages, and whether or not bribes and transportation expenses are included, inserts new dedicated columns, and outputs the data in a CSV file. The raw data has no rules and has unique wording for the medium, and a lot of debugging was required to deal with them.

Main skills used:
- Pandas
- Regex
